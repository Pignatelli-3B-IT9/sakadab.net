<span>Significance of the Project </span>
<p>The ATTENTION:SAKADAB project is significant to the institution because it is a chance for them to be able to reach their goal, such as being self-reliant and to be able to provide for their families. With this goal in mind, we are trying our best in planning this project, and also to cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>This project is important for us Ateneo students because it is a way we can help others, and for us to do what we are called. One of the things us as Ateneans are called to do is to do more, or to do Magis. Being able to do more such as helping the people in need and the people who reach out is the chance for us to fulfill this calling, and also to prepare ourselves to deal with real-life problems. </p>
<p>This project is significant to the general public because it can help them be inspired to do the same, and can also guide them into different interactions with other people. Our project includes different social interactions, such as in online and in real life, since our goal is to reach more audiences for SAKADAB, through our online advertisements. This shows that the project is important to the general public because it has the potential to encourage them to take similar action and direct them toward new social interactions because in order for our solution to be effective or to gain results, we need interactions with other people.<br>
<span>Background of The Project</span>
<p>SAKADAB’s issue is mainly focused on lack of opportunities because of being physically disabled, and financial problems. These problems are the cause of the institution’s other problems such as financial difficulties. This also leads to lack of exposure, which hinders their business in handicraft goods, and bakery in improving in terms with sales.</p>
<p>Financial challenges is the issue facing our institution. The fact that our institutions are making less money from their jobs is the cause of this issue. Due to a shortage of funds, they are unable to provide individuals with food and clothing. The only sources of revenue are handicrafts and a bakery, neither of which generates enough income to cover basic expenses. We would desire a solution to our issue so that the residents of this institution can be given equal opportunities, and also be able to provide for themselves, and their loved ones.</p>
<p>This advertisement project aims to stabilize the institution’s financial difficulties. SAKADAB’s financial difficulties and lack of media exposure causes their businesses’ sales to decrease, and are not consistent. This issue is important to be solved in order for the institution to be more known, and help them to be financially stable through their businesses.
<p>We all know that businesses should make an effort to promote themselves in both in real-life and online. Our group plans to solve this problem through online advertisements, such as online posters that advertise their products. This project does not need a budget, since all the advertising and making of advertisements will be done online. SAKADAB's problem started when their sales started to decrease because of their inconsistent sales. It also started to get worse during the pandemic which started 3 years ago. Lack of familiarity with gaining social media exposure is also one of the causes. According to sir Ludivico, the representative for SAKADAB, helping in making their products be known, and making the public interested in their business can be of big help in their businesses. </p>
</p>
<span>Intervention: Project Proposal</span>
<p>With our project’s benefits, the institution’s financial difficulties will surely be liften, making their profit stable, and will also help them in gaining more sponsors. Having a stable profit will help them be able to have a budget in improving any aspect in their businesses, and also in maintaining their institution’s needs. </p>
<p>The SAKADAB institution supports itself through different businesses, such as baking, and handicrafts. They have shared that their businesses' sales fluctuate, thus sometimes gaining less income than usual. Our group has decided to create a project that helps in advertising their businesses.</p>
<p>Through making online posters, and posting them in different social media platforms, and also providing information about SAKADAB, this can contribute to their businesses, through helping them gain more exposure, and audiences that can help them gain more customers, and also help people be aware of the institution. </p>
