<h1>Decide Model</h1>
<p> 
<span>D</span>- SAKADAB is experiencing financial difficulties, wherein they have limited financial resources to gain access to their necessities.
This problem should be addressed since it affects the members of the institution to be able to support themselves financially, and also 
provide for their family. The institution’s businesses should have a stable income, jobs should have broader requirements, and their business 
should gain support for this problem to be solved. <br>
<br>

<span>E</span>- The established criteria must be for SAKADAB’s businesses to be known, and their mission to be self-reliant to be achieved. In this decision,
 we would like to achieve our goal in making SAKADAB be stable, and be able to have lesser problems or even have no problems at all when it comes
 to finances. We would like to preserve their mission in being self-reliant. As much as possible, we would like to avoid the members of SAKADAB 
 losing hope in their businesses, and their goal. 
<br>

<span>C</span>- The possible alternative we can do in solving the problem is to help the people in the community to not spend money on useless things. 
We can explain to the people in the community to only buy stuff that will be used and to use less electricity so that the bill will be cheaper
and they should stay on a budget when buying things. Secondly. We can ask help them advertise their business’ products, on order to support them.
Lastly, we can use canva or some cool editing apps to make the advirtement more better and if the ad will be eye catching then the problem will be solved. 
<br>

<span>I</span>- Create advertisements online in different social media platforms. Posting online or even just sharing their posts and engaging in different social
 media activities regarding their businesses can help alleviate their issue on financial difficulties, through the help of marketing. We would do this 
 so that people can know more about the business and their products. We would make the advertisment very nice and eyecatching because this will cause 
 people to be more interested in their product and business. <br>
<br>

<span>D</span>- The resources used in the actual implementation process is Canva and Facebook. Using canva we can customize our ads just as we like it and we can publish<br>
 our work through Facebook ads. The other process/the things we need to do are planning, budgeting, timeline, and allocating process. <br>
<br>

<span>E</span>- Something that could most definitely go wrong is if nobody sees our advertisements. If nobody sees our ads then no-one will know about SAKADAB and their many<br>
 businesses. Only 59% of our world's population uses social media and it is also only used by 71% of people from the Philippines so that would mean not many people <br>
 would be able to see our ads and if the ads are uninteresting, the 71% of Filipinos will just scroll past it and not care about SAKADAB or their cause as an institution <br>
 and we can't really control any of this, we can't force people to buy from SAKADAB so we must try to engage people and at least try to get their attention with our project.<br>
