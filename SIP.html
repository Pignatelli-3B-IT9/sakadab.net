	<span><h2>l.Introduction</h2></span><br>	
	
	<center><span><h3>Background and Significance of the Study</h3></span></center>
	<p>- Composting is very important to communities and the environment because this helps in reducing,
	reusing, and recycling one’s waste, which can also contribute to reducing pollution. According to
	UNEP (n.d.), composting aids in lowering greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change 
	by minimizing food waste. Approximately 8 to 10 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are  
	attributed to food loss and waste, and biodiversity is under increasing stress due to the increased 
	usage of land and water resources. Secondly, according to Composting Council (n.d.), composting provides
	environmental advantages that are both immediate and indirect, and it also has the added advantage of 
	preventing landfills from becoming overflowing with trash. This is because compost is created from waste
	materials like food scraps, organic leftovers, and other materials that would otherwise decay in landfills.
	Lastly, according to EPA 2020, composting reduces greenhouse gas emissions by increasing soil carbon 
	sequestration and limiting methane emissions through aerobic decomposition, as methane-producing bacteria
	do not function in the presence of oxygen. This shows that composting is very important to communities and 
	the environment because this helps in reducing, reusing, and recycling one’s waste, which can also contribute 
	to reducing pollution. <br>
<br>
	- Our partner institution, which is the SAKADAB, can make use and benefit from composting in general,
	and from our group’s eggshell compost project by helping them reduce their waste (from their bakery), 
	and also helping them make a business by selling compost fertilizer. According to Fertilizer Machinery 
	(n.d.), organic farming drives the Philippine market for organic fertilizer by increasing demand for it.
	Secondly, Hu S. stated that the organic waste we produce at home can be recycled quite effectively through 
	composting. More than 28% of what we discard is made up of food scraps and yard trash. In addition to
	having a negative impact on the environment, processing food waste is also expensive. Lastly, according 
	to Douglas J. eggshells contain a lot of calcium. The growth and development of plants depend on this 
	macronutrient. Plants can develop more quickly because the calcium in eggshells speeds up the process 
	of constructing cell walls. Additionally, it can aid in reducing the danger of blossom end rot. This
	shows that our partner institution can make use and benefit from composting and from our eggshell compost 
	project by helping them reduce their waste (from their bakery), and also help them make a business by
	selling compost fertilizer because first, the demand for compost is high, thus giving this business the 
	potential to be a success, and secondly, this eggshell compost provides nutrients to the plant thus can make 
	the eggshell compost effective. Lastly, this can help in reducing their waste (from their bakery) because 
	composting can be made with our own food wastes.</p>
	<span><h3>Problem</h3></span>
	<p>- Is there a significant difference in the height of the plants that are exposed to eggshells and those that are not?</p>
	
	<span><h3>Hypothesis</h3></span>
	<p>- If we add eggshells to compost, then the plant will grow higher.</p>
	<span><h2>ll.Methodology</h2></span>
	<span><h3>A.VARIABLES</span></h3>

	<p>Independent Variable <br>
	- Mass of eggshells</p>

	<span>Dependent Variable</span> <br>
	<p>- Height of plant</p>

	<span>Controlled Variable</span><br>
	<p>- Type of plant <br>
    - Type and amount of soil <br>
    -  Amount of water <br>
    - Amount of sunlight</p>
